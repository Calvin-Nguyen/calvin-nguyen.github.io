	        </a>
	        <div class="desc">Starting the design process with user interviews helps set the project in the right direction. Interviews are helpful because they give the designer a general impression of what needs to be done. Questions can be qualitative or quantitative; either way, they should be open ended and phrased in such a way to allow for the interiewees to give you as much information as possible.</div>

	    <!--- Competitor Analysis -->
	    <div class="gallery">

	        </a>
	        <div class="desc">Competitor analysis gives the designer insight on what similar products/services bring to the table and how one can differentiate themselves from others. I chose to select a graphic designer and a UI/UX designer as competitors because they have careers that I plan one day to have myself. I chose an illustrator/concept artist as well because I admire his work and wanted to emulate elements of the design of his site.</div>

	    <!--- Feature Value Matrix -->
	    <div class="gallery">
	  	    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kCvy7TsaatxqRrF7kgdjj1zpchGmHJKg95u0cXcfqS0/edit?usp=sharing">

	        </a>
	        <div class="desc">The feature value matrix helps designers prioritize the features that they want present in their product. The features are usually chosen through the user interviews and competitor analysis. They are weighted by their business value, ease of implementation, and user value. The pattern that arose for high-priority features were ones that had significant user value and that were easy to incorporate in my designs.</div>

	        <div class="desc">I prioritized the features based on the results of the feature value matrix. Designers can use the feature prioritization visualization to make a list of features to work on, starting with the right-most features first, then making their way to the left. This ensures that the most valued features are finished first.</div>

It forces them to use their own work as a user would and judge it with a different perspective, revealing possible flaws and design problems that are not as apparent when it as being designed. I imagined the type of people that would be viewing my portfolio, such as hiring managers and fellow designers, and what I imagined they would want to see.</div>

	        <div class="desc">A cognitive walkthrough is a method of user testing that can enables designers to see how people perceive their interfaces. Users are asked to say their thoughts about the website aloud so that the designer can gain insight about their own designs. I personally had trouble getting my participants to fully explain their thoughts to me.</div>

I chose to conduct a click test and a question test because the former elucidated a point of ambiguity that I thought would be confusing to users, and the latter to see if I my project was heading in the right direction. It seemed that my fears for the click test were confirmed, and some people were in fact confused by where my professional skills would be located.

    <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStarting projects can be hard because I can get overwhelmed and not know where to start. However, this website portfolio was made much easier by starting with user interviews, competitor analysis, etc… These tools gave my project direction and led me through the bulk of the project. All that was left was for me to implement the list of features that I had made through the information that the previous user research had given me. The user tests that were conducted after that site had been more or less finalized allowed me to validate my work and give me feedback about what I could do in the future.</br>

	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUser research presented me with a few challenges, particularly finding people to interview that could represent my target demographic. It was difficult for me to find people of varied background, but I was happy with the people I ended up interviewing and found their responses varied and insightful. Using the competitor analysis to corroborate the features I thought would be essential (personal-but-not-unprofessional, minimal but not plain, etc…), I began to understand the direction the project was heading.</br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter I had turned in my website, user testing began. I needed to validate my work and make sure that I had properly implemented my ideas and features the way my interviewees had meant. While I did stumble a bit in terms of incorporating some features, my website had generally positive feedback on the most important things for me: the look of the website and the personality of the content. My click test revealed slight ambiguities that were a detriment to the effectiveness of my design (mainly where “skills” would be located), but otherwise it seemed that the content was easy to find. My question test revealed that it wasn’t just me that liked how the site looked -- everyone I interviewed said that it was the strong point of my project. The main drawbacks of my site according to user testing were the amount of whitespace and the lack of substantial content for work experience. Large chunks of text were also cited as being detrimental to users, as most skim through websites, whereas mine had long paragraphs that tended to be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>

    <p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI plan to incorporate many of the suggestions I received from user testing into my website. I also plan on implementing things that I either a) did not have time to complete for the assignment or b) have thought of myself while doing user testing.</br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the main critiques I received regarding my portfolio was about the paragraphs of text: they were too long. People are accustomed to skimming through a website’s contents, and my website was no exception. I plan on formatting the text in order to make it more readable. This will also help with my website’s whitespace. While I wanted the design to be clean and somewhat minimal, some feedback I received stated that my website was a little bit too empty. Perhaps after formatting the text, some of this space will be put to better use.</br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother alteration I plan on making is to expand on my skills and experiences in the “work” section. While I have quite a bit written about myself in the “about” section, the focus of a portfolio should be the work. Although I do have my skills and experiences listed, I really need to be more thorough in telling the user what makes me a valuable asset/employee/team-member, etc… I also did not include my musical work experience, although I definitely plan on doing so in the future. A problem I imagine encountering when doing this is integrating more information in the accordion-style layout I currently have. Balancing whitespace and content will be of utmost importance when adding content. </br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomething I did not have enough time to implement was horizontal scrolling. While I have links in the navigation bar to traverse the portfolio, I would like to implement javascript to link the pages as a single page with distinct sections. I would at least like to give the illusion of my site as a one page website, as I’m not the biggest fan of making people scroll through pages of content before finding what they want. My strength does not lie in javascript and so this poses a significant challenge for me in the future.
